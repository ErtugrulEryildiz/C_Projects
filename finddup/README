Improved version of an old program called "finddup", which was posted to Usenet in early 1991. It was written by Bill Davidsen of GE Corporate R&D center, and it was intended to run on a generic Unix system. The purpose of the finddup program is to read an input file containing a list of filenames, determine which of the files in the list have content that duplicates that of other files in the list, and print out a report of the results.

Usage:

Calling sequence: finddup [options] list

where list is a list of files to check, such as generated by "find . -type f -print > file"
    
Options:
    -l   don't list hard links
    -d   debug (must compile with DEBUG)
